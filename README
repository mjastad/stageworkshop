PLEASE READ BEFORE PROCEEDING!

This script currently supports staging HPOC clusters in the NX-US-West region ONLY.

All clusters must be Foundationed prior to Workshop staging. Clusters should be Foundationed according to the AOS/hypervisor versions defined at the bottom of this README - older or new versions may not function as expected. When creating HPOC reservations, do not add addition images (CentOS, Windows2012, etc.) to your reservation.

This script should be run from a host on the corporate/lab network, such as a CentOS VM running on an HPOC cluster.

After deploying a Linux VM with connectivity to the HPOC environment, SSH to the machine and execute the following:

git clone https://github.com/nutanixworkshops/stageworkshop.git
cd stageworkshop
chmod +x stage_workshop.sh

Next you'll need to create a text file containing your cluster IP and password details.

Input files must use the following format:

<Nutanix Cluster #1 IP>|<Cluster #1 Password>
<Nutanix Cluster #2 IP>|<Cluster #2 Password>
...
<Nutanix Cluster #N IP>|<Cluster #N Password>

For example:
1.0.0.1|<CLUSTER PASSWD>
1.0.0.2|<CLUSTER PASSWD>
1.0.0.3|<CLUSTER PASSWD>

Note: It is assumed that Prism 'admin' account, CVM 'nutanix' account, and AHV 'root' account share the same password.

Finally, execute the script to stage the HPOC clusters defined in your text file.

Interactive Usage:        stage_workshop
Non-interactive Usage:    stage_workshop -f cluster_list_file -w workshop_number

Available Workshops:
1) Calm Introduction Workshop (AOS/AHV 5.6)
2) Citrix Desktop on AHV Workshop (AOS/AHV 5.6)

Each staging option will deploy all images required to complete a given workshop, as well as deploying a domain controller (ntnxlab.local), Prism Central, and configuring AHV networks for your Primary and Secondary VLANs.
